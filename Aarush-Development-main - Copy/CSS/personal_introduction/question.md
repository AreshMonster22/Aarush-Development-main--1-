🧩 Goal:
Create a simple webpage about yourself and style it using internal CSS. You'll use headings, paragraphs, and lists — and style them for better visual appeal.

🛠️ Requirements
1. HTML Structure
Create a file called index.html with the following elements:

A <title> in the <head>

A main heading (<h1>) with your name

A paragraph (<p>) introducing yourself

A subheading (<h2>) called "My Hobbies"

An unordered list (<ul>) with at least 3 hobbies

2. CSS Styling
Use a <style> block inside your <head> to style the following:

Set the background-color of the page

Change the font-family to something like "Arial" or "Verdana"

Center-align the main heading (h1)

Make the list items have a different color (like green or blue)

Add some padding and margin to elements for spacing
